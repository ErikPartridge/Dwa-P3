## Project 3 - Developer Helper

Project 3 by Erik Malmstrom-Partridge available on stathack.com (I know, domain doesn't fit the purpose, but it was the only hosting plan of mine I could make it work on).

##  Documentation

This project uses the laravel framework, fzaninotto/faker for user generation assistance, and badcow/lorem-ipsum for lorem ipsum generation

## About

This project provides a couple of developer helper tools, using laravel and forms. Random users can be generated, as can lorem ipsum text, all at the users command! There may be something on stathack.com/fe, you can disregard that- not part of the project. Stathack is my development site, that I had to temporarily repurpose because the site wasn't working on my godaddy shared hosting plan.
